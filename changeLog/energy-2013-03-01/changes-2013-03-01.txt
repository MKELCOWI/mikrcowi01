The objective value changed when implementing the energy market, as the model now accounts for costs associated with 
thermal energy generation.
The two beam.lst files shows the hydro power generation generation before and after implementing the energy market in 
the model. The list files show that the hydro power generation is exactly the same before and after the change.
From this we conclude that the implementation of the thermal energy generation changed the model in the desired way,
i.e. instead of HEPS reacting on exogenous electricity prices, HEPS now react on thermal marginal cost of production
relative to demand not met by thermal generation.
The data provided electricity demand and thermal generation capacity is suited such that they
